# Sediq

A software-defined radio plugin for Kodi/XBMC/OSMC. Used to catch a stream of audio from the rtl_fm_streamer and play it inside OSMC as well as control the rtl_fm program.

*Note:* This software is in early, but functional prototype stage. Thus stations are hard-coded for the LA area.

## Dependencies
